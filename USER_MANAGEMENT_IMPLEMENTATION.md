# User Management System Implementation

## 🎯 Overview
Successfully connected the User Management component to the database and implemented a fully functional admin user management system.

## 🛠 Backend Implementation

### New API Endpoints
1. **GET /api/users** - Fetch all users with application counts
   - Includes user details, roles, status, and job application statistics
   - Admin-only access with authentication

2. **GET /api/users/:id** - Get specific user by ID
   - Detailed user information including profile data
   - Admin-only access

3. **PUT /api/users/:id/status** - Update user status
   - Toggle between Active/Suspended
   - Admin-only access
   - Validates status values

4. **DELETE /api/users/:id** - Delete user account
   - Safely removes user with data cleanup
   - Prevents deletion of admin users
   - Uses database transactions for data integrity

### Database Integration
- Enhanced user queries to include application counts
- Left joins with applications and job_seeker_profiles tables
- Proper UUID handling for user IDs
- Status validation and security checks
